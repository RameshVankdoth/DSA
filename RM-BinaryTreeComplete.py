# Create Node: Write a class TreeNode with int val, left, right.

# Manual Construction: Manually link 3 nodes: Root, Left Child, Right Child.

# Pre-order Traversal: Print Root -> Left -> Right (recursive).

# In-order Traversal: Print Left -> Root -> Right (recursive).

# Post-order Traversal: Print Left -> Right -> Root (recursive).

# Count Nodes: Write a recursive function to count total nodes.

# Sum Nodes: Write a recursive function to sum all values.

# Find Max Height: Find the longest path from Root to Leaf.

# Search Value: Return true if a value exists in the tree.

# Count Leaves: Count nodes that have no children (left and right are null).
